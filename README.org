* Breakbreak
A breakout clone, in uiua!

** Running
*** Nix
It's a flake that comes with everything (mainly =raylib= and =uiua=), so enable it.
#+begin_src bash
  git clone https://github.com/amatgil/breakbreak
  cd breakbreak
  direnv allow # Or 'nix flake develop'
  uiua run
#+end_src
*** Not Nix
Assuming you've got =raylib= and =uiua= installed.
#+begin_src bash
  git clone https://github.com/amatgil/breakbreak
  cd breakbreak
  uiua run
#+end_src

** TODO
- Generate blocks
- Find axis of collision with block
- Take example image when finished
